# Minecraft Voxel Engine
This is my first attempt at recreating Minecraft with OpenGL from scratch (with a few libraries to help out). 
The codebase is kind of messy, but who knows — maybe I’ll remake this in the future.

## Build
### Linux
Build using CMake
```
scripts/build.sh release # Release Mode
scripts/build.sh debug # Debug Mode
```
Or run directly
```
scripts/run.sh release 
scripts/run.sh debug 
```
You can also debug with gdb
```
scripts/debug.sh
```
