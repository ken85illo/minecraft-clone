# Minecraft Voxel Engine
This project is currently in progress, I might update this readme in the future. 
I'm still in the process of learning, so please excuse the poor structure of my codebase. ðŸ˜…

For now, I have implemented chunk mesh culling and octave perlin noise for random terrain generation.
